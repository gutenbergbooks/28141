<h2>EBONY AND LUCY.</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 119px;">
<img src="images/illus034.png" width="119" height="125" alt="E" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br /><br />BONY is the name of Lucy's black dog. I will
leave you to guess why he is so called.</div>

<p>On a bright, cold winter day, when no wind
was stirring, and the ice of the pond was
smooth as glass, Lucy went out, followed by
Ebony. Such joyful barking as there was!</p>

<p>Her father knew that the good dog would pull her out of
the water, if the ice should break through. But the day
was so cold, there was little danger from thin ice.</p>

<p>A bright idea occurred to Lucy when she had put on her
skates. She had scarfs and handkerchiefs with her, and,
tying three or four of these together, she made a noose,
which she threw over Ebony's head. Thus she held him, so
that he could pull her on her skates over the ice.</p>

<p>"Now, Ebony, let us see how fast you can go," said Lucy.
Ebony started at a full gallop; and she began to sing,&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
"We issue no tickets, we close no gate,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">We blow no whistle, and nobody's late;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Our train is off as soon as we're in it;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">We go at the rate of ten miles a minute,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">(And that is six hundred miles an hour!)&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">For ours is an engine of one-dog power;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">But that dog's Ebony, bold and fleet,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">A dog, you'll find, that is hard to beat:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">So look out, stragglers and tramps! I guess</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">You'd better not trifle with our express!"</span><br />
</div>

<p>Hardly had Lucy finished her song, when Ebony, who
had been going at great speed for some distance, slipped on
his haunches, where the ice was very smooth, and, sliding
along, fell over on his side.</p>

<p>Lucy fell too, but she was not hurt. "You good Ebony,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
said she. "You have done well. But it is too bad to
make you play the part of a locomotive engine. And
so, old fellow, I will take off your harness, and let you go
free."</p>

<p>Then Lucy took the scarf from the dog's neck, and darted
off alone on her skates to a part of the pond where her
brother Felix had just had a tumble on the ice.</p>

<p>But Ebony would not forsake her. He kept close at her
heels; for he knew there was water underneath the ice,
and he meant to be near at hand, should any accident
happen. I am glad to say, that, after a good frolic on the
ice, they reached home safely in time for dinner.</p>

<h2>THE TERRIBLE TRIO.</h2>


<div class='poem'>
<span class="smcap">These</span> are the robbers,&mdash;the terrible three!<br />
In showing no mercy they all agree;<br />
They fill the woods with their war-whoops dire:<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>Policemen and soldiers, beware, retire!<br />
<br />
Rinaldo's the name of the captain: you learn<br />
His rank from his cap, and his frown so stern.<br />
The next is Grimaldi, a desperate fellow!<br />
His eyes they are blue, and his hair it is yellow.<br />
<br />
The youngest but dreadfulest of them all<br />
Has a terrible name that I cannot recall:<br />
'Tis hard to pronounce; and it's well, perhaps,<br />
That memory here has suffered a lapse.<br />
<br />
Oh! doesn't it make you all shudder to look<br />
At their likenesses even, all here in a book?&mdash;<br />
Rinaldo the fierce, and Grimaldi the grim,<br />
And that young, nameless bandit, so bold and so trim.<br />
<br />
But if you should meet with this terrible band,<br />
Now don't run away, but come quick to a stand:<br />
Be humble and quiet, and don't act amiss,<br />
And all that they'll rob you of, will be&mdash;a kiss!<br />

<h2>DAISY.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">A friend</span> of mine, Mr. S., had a beautiful colt named
Daisy, who was the pet of all the family. She was so tame
she would put her head in at the open windows to see what
was going on in the house; and very often, when she saw
the front-door open, she would go up the steps of the
piazza, and deliberately march into the hall. No one ever
struck Daisy with a whip, or even a switch. A little slap
of the hand, and a "Go out, Daisy," were all that were
necessary.</p>

<p>Mrs. S. had a new cook; and one day she set a pan of
custard on the back-porch to cool. When she went out to
get it, an hour or two after, she found nothing but the empty
pan. Molly ran to Mrs. S. in great distress, and told her of
the loss of the custard. "Ah!" said Mrs. S., "then Daisy
has eaten it." And, sure enough, Daisy was the thief.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>Another time the naughty colt put her head in the kitchen-window,
and ate up some apple-pies that were on the table.
All this was very bad indeed, but Daisy was always forgiven
because she was so lovely and gentle. She would follow
any of the family about the grounds, and rub her head
against them to show how much she loved them.</p>

<p>One day a man came to Mr. S.'s house to make a visit.
He was not in the habit of visiting the family, and so had
not made Daisy's acquaintance. After tea, Mr. S. and his
visitor were standing on the piazza, when Daisy came trotting
up, as she always did when she saw one of the family
there, and opened her mouth, expecting Mr. S. to put a
piece of bread or apple in. The stranger did not understand
this little trick, and (coarse man that he was!) spat a
quantity of tobacco-juice into Daisy's face. Poor little
Daisy! She hung her head down, and walked off under the
trees, where she stood looking very miserable.</p>

<p>The next morning Mr. S. asked his visitor to walk with
him through his grounds; and, as they were walking along,
they passed a place where Daisy, who still looked as if she
felt insulted and injured, was quietly grazing.</p>

<p>As soon as she saw her enemy (as she must have considered
him), she pricked up her ears as if some happy idea
had come into her head. She gave herself a little shake,
and, walking behind him until she was quite near, suddenly
wheeled around, and gave a kick that would have broken
some of his bones, if he had not jumped out of the way just
in time to escape her heels.</p>

<p>As it was, he was very much frightened, and looked very
mean; for he knew that a kick was just what he deserved
for his vulgarity and insolence.</p>

<p>Daisy had never been known to kick at anybody before,
and she never kicked anybody afterwards.</p>

<h2>THE FAMOUS MOZART BAND.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> famous Mozart Band, as everybody ought to know,
was formed in our village. It has serenaded almost every
family on the street; and there is no end to the money (in
the form of beans and smooth stones) that has been poured
into the hat carried round by Miss Amy, the youngest
member.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus039.png" width="500" height="335" alt="Mozart Band" title="" />
</div>

<p>The band is composed of five members, whose names are
Charles, Edwin, Susan, Bella, and Amy. Charles was the
founder of the band. While on a visit to his uncle in the
city, he had seen a strolling band of men in the street, who
played finely on trumpets and flutes. He resolved to form
a band at home, and to call it the Mozart Band.</p>

<p>But why call it the Mozart? Well, Mozart was a wonderful
musical genius, who could compose music when he
was five years old, and who astonished all Germany by his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
skill and aptness as a performer. So Charles decided on
calling his band the Mozart Band.</p>

<p>At great expense I have obtained a drawing of the members
of the Mozart Band. Charles (first drum) is the leader;
Edwin (second drum) is next in rank; Amy (trumpet) is
the next, for she owns the trumpet, and so comes before the
other two ladies, who are merely vocal performers, by which
I mean singers.</p>

<p>Now, if you want to hear the famous Mozart Band, you
must come to our village. Performances take place every
Wednesday and Saturday afternoon, and sometimes oftener.
If you come, you must bring some money to put into Amy's
hat; for the band cannot afford to play for nothing. They
are getting to be so famous that I should not wonder if they
were to have an invitation soon to come on to New York
or Boston, and give a concert in one of the large halls.</p>

<h2>MY FIRST ATTEMPT AT FISHING.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> I was seven years old, my father took me down to
the river to fish. I had a nice new line, and a little hook
that I bought of a peddler the week before. My father cut
me a pole from the woods near by; and I caught a grasshopper
for bait.</p>

<p>I tried to put the grasshopper on the hook, but I pricked
my finger: so my father put it on for me. Then I threw
in my line, and kept moving it up and down.</p>

<p>Pretty soon I thought I felt a bite, and called out to my
father, "O father, I've got a fish!" I pulled it up, and
what do you think I had caught? You could not guess in
a week. It was my sister's old rag baby.</p>

<h2>SHY LITTLE PANSY.</h2>


<div class='poem'>
"<span class="smcap">Why</span> so shy, my Pansy,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Tell me why so shy?</span><br />
Mother's arms are round thee;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">This is grandma by.</span><br />
She can tell you stories<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of the time, my dear,</span><br />
When she was a little girl<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Just like Pansy here.</span><br />
<br />
"Once there was a dolly,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And its name was Bess;</span><br />
Grandma then, like Pansy,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Was&mdash;how old? Now guess!</span><br />
Just the age of Pansy!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Well, one night, you see"&mdash;</span><br />
"Grandma," said the little girl,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Take me on your knee."</span><br />
<br />
Pansy's shyness melted;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Grandma won the day:</span><br />
Now hugged tight in grandma's arms<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Little Pansy lay;</span><br />
And she heard a story<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of a doll so fine,</span><br />
Left out on the cold, cold ground,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where no sun could shine.</span><br />
<br />
And the snow fell slowly,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Softly fell, like down,</span><br />
Till a heap of drifted flakes<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Covered dolly's gown.</span><br />
Yes, it hid and covered<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">All the bright blue dress,</span><br />
Then her hair and rosy cheeks&mdash;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Poor forsaken Bess!</span><br />
<br />
Dolly's little mother<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Hunted for her child;</span><br />
But no trace of her was seen<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Till the air grew mild.</span><br />
When the snow was melted,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">There was dolly found,</span><br />
With her silken dress all soiled<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On the muddy ground.</span><br />

<h2>NEW METHOD OF CATCHING MICE.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Perhaps</span> some of your youthful readers will be glad to
know how I catch mice. If you think so, you are at liberty
to publish the following; for I do not intend to apply for a
patent.</p>

<p>One evening last week we made some molasses candy;
and, as too much of it, eaten before going to bed, is not good
for the teeth, I spread some on a baking-tin, and set it away
to cool for the next day.</p>

<p>It was not cooked enough to harden thoroughly; and a
little mouse had the curiosity to taste it; but, the moment
his feet touched it, they stuck fast, and he could not get
away.</p>

<p>His cries for help brought two other mice to his assistance;
but they shared the same fate, the molasses candy
holding all three prisoners.</p>

<p>When I found them the next morning, all three were
stuck fast. This shows what a useful thing molasses candy
is to have in a house, and is a warning to all mice not to
meddle with it.</p>

<h2>A SONG FOR BABY.</h2>


<div class='poem'>
<span class="smcap">Nuts</span> for all the baby-birds<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the merry budding spring;</span><br />
Roses, where the dusty bees<br />

<br />
Shade for all the pretty lambs<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That in the summer stray;</span><br />
Hedges, where the crickets chirp<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Their time away.</span><br />
<br />
Holes, where nimble squirrels hide<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When autumn hours are chill;</span><br />
Heaping barns, where horse and cow<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Have shelter still.</span><br />
<br />
Homes for rabbit, mouse, and mole,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When winter strews the ground;</span><br />
But mother's arms for baby dear<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The whole year round!</span><br />

Freddy Bassett, a four-year-old neighbor, love to play in
the dirt; and their mammas allow them to do it, because it
is so healthy.</p>

<p>It certainly has proved to be so in Jamie's case; for he
was quite pale and delicate in the spring, and now he is
brown and rugged, and ready to eat all the food he can get.
But dear me! he used to get so dirty!</p>

<p>What was the use of washing him, and putting on clean
dresses and aprons, when he was constantly throwing aside
his other playthings, and making mud pies, or carting earth
in his little red wagon?</p>

<p>His papa laughed and said, "Oh, never mind! Dirt is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
good for him." But mamma thought it was not very good
for his clothes; and, besides, she wanted him to be clean
enough to kiss without being washed every time he came
into the house.</p>

<p>So she said one day to his papa, "James, I think it
would be a good idea to get a load of sand for Jamie to play
in. It will at least be cleaner than that dust-heap."</p>

<p>That very day up came a load of yellow, shining sand.
It was heaped into a shady corner by mamma's bedroom-door,
and Jamie and Freddy dived into it at once.</p>

<p>They made pies; they dug holes, and filled them with
water for wells; they made mountains with caves in their
sides, and every thing else they could think of. When
dinner-time came, Jamie had to be coaxed away from his
sand-heap; and mamma said she believed he would sleep
in it, if he were allowed to.</p>

<p>After dinner, as soon as he waked from his nap, he went
straight to his sand again. Freddy was there before him;
and soon Minnie Rich, a little girl eleven years old, came
out, and played with them.</p>

<p>She knew how to work sand better than any of them.
First she wet it. Then she made a house with holes in the
sides for doors and windows, and a chip for a chimney.
Then she made a smooth lawn in front of the house, and
some hills and valleys in the rear, fenced in a yard, and set
out some flowers.</p>

<p>The boys were delighted; and mamma went to the door
more than once to look at the plantation, as Jamie called
it, before it was finished. It was really quite a pretty
thing, and Jamie declared his intention of keeping it just as
it was. But the hot sun dried the sand, so that the house
crumbled away; and the two boys were soon digging and
shovelling in their own way as before.</p>

<h2>DICK'S DREAM.</h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Yes</span>, step right down upon me, and kill me, if you
like," said Mrs. Tarantula to Dick, as they met at the schoolhouse
door. "This is a hard world, Dick Adams, and I am
about tired of living in it.</p>

<p>"You don't know what a fine home I once had! It was
in that clay mound; and, when I had dug me a hole fully a
foot deep and an inch across, my jaws and my eight legs
were quite tired out. I left some small stones on the side
for stairs: I lined the hole with brown silk next to the dirt,
and with white satin inside, both of which I spun and wove
on the spot.</p>

<p>"My nice round lid fitted so snug and even, that I thought
no one but myself ever could find my house. But, last
week, your brother Will's sharp eyes spied the round ring<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
that marks my nest; and he went and tore the lid from its
hinges, and left my hundred and ten children without a roof
to cover their heads. <i>How I would like to bite that boy!</i></p>

<p>"I found the lid, and tried to fasten it down again; but
a heavy shower came up, and I could not fix it in the rain.
Then my husband came over from his house. You know
our husbands never live with the rest of the family. They
are too cross and get too hungry at times.</p>

<p>"We were not on very good terms; for, some time before,
when he thought I was away from home, he tried to get
into my house. I heard him, and, running up stairs, I put
my claws in the two little holes in the lining of the lid, and
braced myself so that he could not pry open the lid. He
said he only wanted to pay me a visit; but I knew he was
hungry, and wanted to eat up our children.</p>

<p>"But now he spoke very kindly to me, and told me that
my lid could not be fixed on; but, as my children were now
old enough to care for themselves, I had better go home
with him. I went to his house to talk it over and forgot to
give the children their supper, and tell them to work for
themselves after this.</p>

<p>"My husband told me a few days after that my boys and
girls got into a fight, and, before they quit, ate each other
up; but he was away from home for two days, and looked
very full when he came back.</p>

<p>"He may have told the truth; but I can't see how one of
my little ones could eat the other one hundred and nine,
and then swallow himself too."</p>

<p>This is what Dick Adams dreamed that a tarantula said to
him. He had seen one on his way to school, and what the
teacher told him about the insect had interested him so
much that he found himself dreaming about it all night.</p>

<h2>THREE LITTLE CHICKS.</h2>


<div class='poem'>
<span class="smcap">Three</span> little chicks, so downy and neat,<br />
Went out in search of something to eat:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Ter-wit, ter-weet!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Something to eat!</span><br />
And soon they picked up a straw of wheat.<br />
</div>

<div class='poem'>
Said one little chick, "That belongs to me!"<br />
Said the other little chick, "We'll see, we'll see!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">"Ter-wit, ter-weet!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">It is nice and sweet,"</span><br />
Said number three: "let us share the treat!"<br />
<br />
One little chick seized the straw in his bill,<br />
And was just preparing to eat his fill,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">When the other chick</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Stepped up so quick,</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>He hadn't a chance for a picnic pick.<br />
<br />
They pulled, and they tugged, the downy things;<br />
And, oh, how they flapped their baby wings!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">"Ter-wit, ter-weet!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Something to eat!</span><br />
Just please let go of this bit of wheat!"<br />
<br />
Fiercer and fiercer the battle grew,<br />
Until the straw broke right in two,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">And the little chicks</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Were in a fix,</span><br />
And sorry enough for their naughty tricks.<br />
<br />
For a saucy crow has watched the fight,<br />
And laughs, "Haw, haw! It serves you right!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">So he snatches the prize</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">From before their eyes,</span><br />
And over the hills, and away, he flies!<br />

<h2>ROMEO THE SHIRK.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Sixty</span> years ago, when grandpa was a boy, he had a dog
called Romeo, who was made to do the work of churning
butter. I never saw a churn that went by dog-power; but
it must have been a clumsy affair.</p>

<p>The task could not have been an agreeable one, and I do
not wonder that Romeo did not like it. One morning, when
the churn was taken out, and the cream was all ready to be
made into butter, there was no Romeo to be found. Long
and loud were the calls made for him; but he did not
answer to his name.</p>

<p>The churning was done that day without his help. Nothing
was seen of him until just before dark, when he came<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
into the house with the air of a prodigal son. He did not
walk up like an honest dog to get his supper, but slunk
under a table.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus052.png" width="500" height="369" alt="Romeo" title="" />
</div>

<p>The family had agreed to neither chide him nor caress
him; but grandfather, who was then a little boy, slyly
carried him some supper. Romeo ate it greedily, but
looked unhappy all the time as though he knew he had done
wrong. It was plain that his conscience was smiting him.</p>

<p>The next week, when churning-time came, Romeo did not
try to get away. He stood by watching while the cream
was made ready; and, when his master whistled for him to
take his place at the churn, he came forward, wagging his
tail, as much as to say, "I am not going to be a shirk. I
was not half so happy the day I ran away as I should have
been if I had done my work cheerfully. I will never be
caught shirking again." And he never was.</p>

<h2>TIED, NOT MATED.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">One</span> fine summer day, Master Fritz took his mother's
greyhound, Leda, and his father's spaniel, Neptune, out for
a run. They were quite ready for a frolic, for they had
been tied up in the barn all the forenoon, and had been
longing for Fritz to come.</p>

<p>So off they went; and, after they had gone some distance,
Fritz thought it would be fine fun, as he had in his pocket a
piece of string, to tie the two dogs together, and play they
were a span of horses.</p>

<p>No sooner had he got them well tied than some one called
him, and off he ran, leaving the two dogs tied, but not
mated. They roamed about a while over the fields and
meadows, till they came to the pond.</p>

<p>Now, the dogs could not talk in our language; but they
made certain noises, which meant, I think, just this: "Here's
a chance for a fine swim!" cried Neptune. "Come, Leda,
the water is nice and cool."</p>

<p>"I'd rather not go in," said Leda. "I'm not a very
good swimmer, and I easily take cold. Pray don't drag
me in. Come back and have a race in the meadow."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus055.png" width="500" height="361" alt="Tied" title="" />
</div>

<p>"Oh, it's too fine, too fine!" barked Neptune; and he
began to lap up water with his tongue.</p>

<p>Leda pulled back, and cried, "Oh, don't!"</p>

<p>But the temptation was too great for Neptune. In he
pulled poor Leda, and swam about with her till she was
chilled through.</p>

<p>Fritz's father, Mr. Pitman, passing that way, saw the dogs,
and called them out. Glad enough was Leda to get on dry
land. She shivered; but Neptune shook himself till he
drenched her all over.</p>

<p>Then Mr. Pitman untied the dogs, and, taking some dry
grass, gave Leda a good rubbing till she felt warm and
brisk.</p>

<p>Then she began to bark at Neptune, and to caper round
him, as much as to say, "Did you not serve me a pretty
trick, sir? But I shall not let Master Fritz tie me to you
again. Never, never!"</p>

<img src="images/illus058.png" width="500" height="283" alt="A Lesson in Flying" title="" />
</div>




<p><span class="smcap">Birds</span> have their trials as well as little boys and girls.
To be sure they don't have to stand in a line, and shout
"Twice one are two" at the top of their voices; but they
have to learn to fly, and I think it very likely that they
take singing-lessons, although I am not sure as to that.</p>

<p>One day last summer I was picking flowers in the woods,
when, happening to look up, what should I see perched on
a twig just in front of me but a cunning little bird!</p>

<p>At first I kept very quiet, lest I should frighten him away;
but, as he showed no sign of moving, I ventured nearer and
nearer, until I even covered him with my hand.</p>

<p>"Why, dear me! he's nothing but a baby-bird, and can't
fly," I said to myself; and then I sat down on a mossy
mound near by, and waited; for I knew the mother-bird was
not far off, and I wanted to see what was going on.</p>

<p>It was not long before I heard a gentle whirr in the leaves
overhead, and, looking up, saw two birds circling around the
twig, but at some distance above it. Then one of them,
the mother, of course, drew nearer and nearer in smaller
and smaller circles, at the same time calling to her baby in
encouraging little chirps.</p>

<p>Birdie on his perch seemed very much excited, turning<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
his head from one side to the other in the cunningest way.
But when his mother came close to him, only to dart off and
call on him to follow, he looked so disappointed that I really
felt as if I must comfort him.</p>

<p>The mother came back very soon and resumed her lesson
in flying, and very hard work she found it too, for the little
fellow was timid and refused to follow her, in spite of all
her coaxing and scolding. After working a long while, she
flew off, leaving her baby trembling on his perch. I pitied
the poor little fellow, he seemed so forlorn and helpless.</p>

<p>The little bird, left to himself, got tired at last of staying
where he was, and made one or two efforts to fly. He
flapped his wings, rounded up his back until he looked like
a ball of down, and leaned forward, as much as to say,
"I'll do it now." But when he saw the awful distance
between himself and the ground, his courage failed him, and
he clung to his perch more tightly than ever.</p>

<p>After a while the mother-bird came back, bringing a large
bug which she used as a bribe for her timid birdling, holding
it under his very bill, and then darting off in the hope that
he would follow. The youngster chirped for the bug, but
he would not fly for it; and, after many efforts, the old
bird, unable to resist his pleading, perched on a twig just
beneath him, and held up the bug, which you may be sure
he was not slow to seize and eat.</p>

<p>The little fellow now seemed to make up his mind to fly,
even if he died in the attempt. He flapped his wings,
rounded his back, and leaned forward as before, while the
mother-bird flew about, fluttering and chirping to such an
extent that the father came down from the top of a high
tree to see how they were getting along.</p>

<p>The little bird was just about to fly, and I was just ready
to clap my hands in applause, when, lo! there he was clinging<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
to his perch again, trembling with fear, and chirping,
"I can't do it. I dare not. Oh, dear!"</p>

<p>The two old birds flew away much disappointed; but the
mother soon returned with another bug, and the lesson was
repeated. Indeed it was repeated so many times, that I
began to lose patience with the little coward, and to be full
of pity for the poor tired mother.</p>

<p>His birdship had just eaten a bug, and the parent-birds
were chirping and flying around, when, with the hope of
helping them in their labors, I stepped forward, and tapped
him on the bill with a flower-stem. The blow was so sudden
and unexpected, that, before he had time to think, he
lifted his wings and flew to a neighboring twig, where he
clung, frightened and delighted at what he had done.</p>

<p>I left him then, with his father and mother making just
such a time over him as your fathers and mothers made
over you when you took your first steps.</p>

<h2>HOW LITTLE EDITH WENT TO SLEEP.</h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">I'm</span> sleepy; and I want my mamma to rock me to sleep;
and I don't want grandma, or auntie, or papa, or any one
else, to rock me, but just my own mamma." And the little
queen planted her feet firmly, and looked at us with so much
defiance, that we felt it was of no use for us to coax, rock,
or sing.</p>

<p>Little Edith was tired, and sadly in need of her nap; but
her mamma was sick in bed, and could not be disturbed.
What was to be done?</p>

<p>Papa held up a bright silver-piece as a reward of merit to
the little girl, if she would be good, and go to sleep. Grandma
ventured a little coaxing. But it was all of no avail: the
sleepy eyes opened wide, as if they meant to keep open in
spite of us all.</p>

<p>But when auntie remarked that she was going to her
room to sharpen her pencil, and draw some pictures of a
cat, or a dog, or a rabbit, Edith's eyes brightened; and she
said, "Let me go too?"</p>

<p>So Edith sat on her auntie's lap, and asked her to draw a
rabbit,&mdash;a "yabbit," Edith called it,&mdash;and to begin at his
ears.</p>

<p>"Yes, little pet. Here are his ears, and here is his body,
and here is his tail, and here are his feet, and here are some
spectacles for him to see through," said auntie, drawing
each article as she named it. "And here are some pretty
red beads around his neck, and some rings in his ears; and
now we will tie a nice blue ribbon on his tail." Here Edith
suggested shoes for his feet.</p>

<p>"Yes," said auntie. "And now he wants an apple to
eat: so here is an <i>apple</i> for him (1). Now he wants some
<i>grass</i> (2); now some <i>nuts</i> (3). Now he is crying for a piece<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
of <i>pie</i> (4); no, he doesn't want that kind, he wants <i>gooseberry-pie</i>:
well, rabbit, here it is (5). Here is some <i>bread</i>
for him (6), and we will spread it with nice butter; and he
wants a <i>potato</i> too (7), and a nice sweet <i>orange</i> (8), and
a <i>brush</i> to smooth his fur (9)."</p>

<p>Little Edith's eyes were gradually closing; but, becoming
aware of the fact, she started up as if she thought of going
away.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus063.png" width="500" height="273" alt="numbered pictures" title="" />
</div>

<p>"Stop, darling," said auntie. "We must give the rabbit
a <i>wash-bowl</i> to wash in (10), and some nice cool water in
it; and now he must have a <i>comb</i> (11), and a <i>cup and
saucer</i> to drink his tea from (12), and a <i>doll</i> to play with
(13). Now he says he wants a <i>house</i> to live in (14), with a
tree growing by it, and a nice walk to the front-door, and
a fence all around it; and there he is crying for a bed to
sleep on. Oh, what a rabbit you are! you want so many
things! Well, here is a nice <i>bed</i> for you (15). Now I hope
you will go to sleep, and not ask for another thing; for
little Edith's eyes are shut."</p>

<p>And, sure enough, Edith was fast asleep.</p>

1. Blow, blow, east wind!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">What does the east wind do?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Shine, shine, sunlight!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And what does the sunshine do?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The sunshine clear</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Goes here and there,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And searches ev'ry nook;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And while it is going,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The wind it is blowing</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Much farther than you can look.</span><br />
<br />
2. Blow, blow, east wind!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Woodlands and valleys through!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Shine, shine, sunlight!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With beams of a golden hue</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The fields grow green</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">By winds swept clean,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But end your blowing, do!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And south breezes dear</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Very soon will be here</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With the skies of a deep warm blue.</span><br />
